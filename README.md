## 🌟 Projects & Demos

Here are a few examples of what I’ve worked on with Graal.js and related technologies:

- **Polyglot JavaScript Engine Demos** – Integrating JavaScript into Java applications using GraalVM.  
- **Server-side React Rendering** – Rendering charts entirely on the server using GraalVM.  
- **Custom TypeScript Runtime** – Built a system for compiling and executing TypeScript entirely within GraalJS, enabling full TypeScript support.
- **Performance Optimization Benchmarks** – Conducted benchmarks and optimizations for GraalJS-based applications, significantly improving throughput and overall execution speed.
- **GraalJS 25 Early Testing** – Tested the upcoming GraalJS 25 release ahead of its official launch (planned September 2025).  
  Responsibilities included identifying **performance regressions**, **compatibility issues**, and **runtime stability problems**, as well as reporting **bugs and limitations** to ensure a smooth release.
